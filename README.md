# Deep_Learning_Final_Project

### Theme : Brain Tumor Segmentation : Explainable AI based on multi-modal deep learning

This project aims to construct a multi-modal segmentation deep learning model for brain lesion areas using the T1, T2, T1Gd, and T2-Flair MRI datasets provided in the BraTS Challenge 2021. It seeks to capture subtle differences that might be missed when using only a single modality by leveraging the complementary features of each modality.
In doing so, it applies Grad-CAM to validate the weights of features, fine-tunes the feature maps, and enhances the model's performance. This process ensures interpretability and reliability of the model by securing insights into the significance of different features.
